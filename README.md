*Test your music compatibility with your friends and significant others!*

Inspiration
-----------

Music is a window to the soul. We wanted to peek into the hearts of our friends to test their musical compatibilities with us.

Description
-----------

Compatify was a project we completed over 12 hours at the 5C Hackathon (Spring 2016) at Pomona College. The app looks at Spotify users' saved music and determines the similarity in their tastes in music. When two users use Compatify, it also creates a playlist of songs that both of the users enjoy.

How We Built It
---------------

We used Python, Flask, and Spotipy to develop our backend, and HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and D3.js to develop our frontend.

Roles
-----

Frontend & Design: Catherine Ma, Celia Zhang

Backend & API Integration: Joon Hee Lee, Joseph Donermeyer
